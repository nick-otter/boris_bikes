## Boris Bikes
Midweek task, assigned by [Kay Lovelace](https://github.com/neoeno), [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/).

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system have come to us asking us to implement a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. The program emulates all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make the above a reality.
